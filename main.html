	<h1>Time,Space and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a key concept in computer science used to describe the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of the number of operations it performs relative to the size of the input.An algorithm is considered efficient if its time complexity is low, meaning it can handle large inputs within a reasonable amount of time.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b>refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of the input. Just as time complexity evaluates efficiency in terms of time, space complexity evaluates efficiency in terms of memory usage. One common notation for space complexity is O(n), which means that the algorithmâ€™s memory usage grows linearly with the size of the input.</p>
